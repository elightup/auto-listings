# CMB2-grid
A grid system for Wordpress [CMB2](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/cmb2) library that allows the creation of columns for a better layout in the admin.

## Installation

For now you have to install this as a WordPress plugin:

1. Download the plugin
2. Place the plugin folder in your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin in the Plugin dashboard


## Usage
Create your cmb2 metabox like you always do:

```php
$prefix = '_yourprefix_demo_';
$cmb = new_cmb2_box(array(
	'id'			 => $prefix . 'metabox',
	'title'			 => __('Test Metabox', 'cmb2'),
	'object_types'	 => array('page',), // Post type
));

$field1 = $cmb->add_field(array(
	'name'		 => __('Test Text', 'cmb2'),
	'desc'		 => __('field description (optional)', 'cmb2'),
	'id'		 => $prefix . 'text',
	'type'		 => 'text',
));

$field2 = $cmb->add_field(array(
	'name'		 => __('Test Text2', 'cmb2'),
	'desc'		 => __('field description2 (optional2)', 'cmb2'),
	'id'		 => $prefix . 'text2',
	'type'		 => 'text',
));
```
Now, create your columns like this:

```php
if(!is_admin()){
	return;
}
$cmb2Grid = new \Cmb2Grid\Grid\Cmb2Grid($cmb);
$row = $cmb2Grid->addRow();
$row->addColumns(array($field1, $field2));
```

You can also use custom bootstrap column classes if you want, like this

```
$row->addColumns(array(
   array($field1, 'class' => 'col-md-8'),
   array($field2, 'class' => 'col-md-4')
));
```

**FAQ**
- There is no need to load the grid code on frontend so I loaded all the grid classes on admin only. So **it is important to run the code only on admin side**, or the frontend will break. Just do like the example
- It works on [group fields](https://github.com/origgami/CMB2-grid/wiki/Groal-fields) also
- If you want, you can opt to use the metabox and the field IDs also.
- Currently the grid system is using a lite version of Twitter Bootstrap
- You can create as much rows as you want
- You have to put the fields in the columns in the same order they were created
- You can follow exactly what is in [Test/Test.php](https://github.com/origgami/CMB2-grid/blob/master/Test/Test.php) file to see it in action
