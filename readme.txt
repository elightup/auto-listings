= Vehicle Data for car dealers =
Easily populate the vehicle details and specs by simply choosing the vehicle year, make and model.
No more manually typing all of your vehicle data. **Car dealers** love this!

You simply need to choose the year, the make and the model of the vehicle and then click the 'Populate the Fields' button to auto populate each field.

The car data is pulled from [CarQuery](http://www.carqueryapi.com/) and the CarQuery database contains over 68,000 vehicles from over 150 manufacturers going all the way back to 1941 until today.


= Advanced Search =
The search box is extremely smart and can be customized to suit your needs.

There are tons of options and you can choose which fields you want to add to the search box.

There is also a radius search that allows users to narrow the search results to their region. This uses a combination of Google Maps Geocoding and radius searching to deliver the relevant results.

= Google Maps =
Google Maps is integrated into each listing. When adding a listing, you simply need to start typing the address and Google will help you find the exact address and location. You can even move the map marker and place wherever you like.

On the listing page, it will not pinpoint an exact address, it will instead show a circle of the area. Which avoids giving away any personal addresses.

= Shortcodes =

    [auto_listings_listing]
    [auto_listings_listings]
    [auto_listings_search]
    [auto_listings_contact_form]

The shortcodes can be easily customized, with each shortcode having many options.

Visit the [shortcodes docs page](https://wpautolistings.com/docs/shortcodes/) for more info.

= Template System =

A robust, flexible framework & template system gives you full control over every aspect of your automotive website, so you can customize it to fit your needs.

Easily override the default HTML template files by including them into your own theme.

The template system used is very similar to the WooCommerce template system, so if you have used that before, this will be a breeze.
